# Scallop and Logic Programming

In this part of the book we introduce Scallop as a relational and logical programming language.
Scallop is a Datalog based language extended with various language features such as negation, aggregation, disjunctive head, algebraic data type, foreign functions, and foreign predicates.
We will explain all of these concepts in detail, aiming to provide a comprehensive introduction to the core language constructs.
