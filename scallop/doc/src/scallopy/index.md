# The Scallop Python Binding `scallopy`

`scallopy` is the Python binding for Scallop, offering an interface for computationg with Scallop in Python.
In addition, it can be integrated with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org), allowing users to write Neuro-Symbolic applications that can be connected to PyTorch.
In this section, we elaborate on how to install, configure, and use the `scallopy` library.

For an example, please look at [Getting Started](getting_started.md).
To start reading the documentation, proceed to [Scallopy Context](context.md)
