/// A dataflow trait
///
/// A dataflow will be divided into stable parts and recent parts.
/// Each part returns a sequence of batches (as defined by `Batches`).
/// One batch will further be iterated and collected into individual
/// elements.
///
/// The sequence of recent batches represent the new elements that
/// we want to add into the system. This is as opposed to the sequence
/// of stable batches, which represents the elements that are already
/// inside of the system.
///
/// Inside a statically compiled dataflow, stable batches and recent
/// batches can have separate types. Any type that instantiates this
/// dataflow trait must provide a `Stable` type and a `Recent` type.
/// Henceforth, the `iter_stable` function will return the sequence
/// of stable batches, and the `iter_recent` function will return the
/// sequence of recent batches.
